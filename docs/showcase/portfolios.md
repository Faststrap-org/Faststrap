# Portfolio Showcases

We provide two distinct portfolio layouts to demonstrate how FastStrap can be used for personal branding, from minimalist defaults to high-impact custom designs.

## 1. Standard Portfolio
A clean, professional layout using default FastStrap components and the basic "light" theme.

### Key Features
- **Responsive Navbar**: With sticky positioning and brand slot.
- **Hero Section**: Centered headline and call-to-action using the default background.
- **Project Grid**: Cards with headers and footers to display work.
- **Skill Badges**: Using the `Badge` component with pill styling.

> [!TIP]
> This layout is perfect for developers who want a fast, batteries-included look without custom CSS.
